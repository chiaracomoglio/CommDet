Description of the Code
-----------------------

The main contains the following parts:

- The subfolder *./core* contains the core code of the package for graph signal approximation: the proposed approach combines a spectral community detection method with the Partition of Unity method (PUM)

- The subfolder *./data* contains several *.mat* files, some imported from [6] and some obtained by converting the datasets available in [7] from the *.gml* format to the *.mat* format

- The subfolder *./images* contains some significant plots generated by the scripts

- The script **example_communities.m** is a simple example of applying the community detection method from Algorithm 3.2 and visualizing the magnitudes of the elements of $u_1$. It also demonstrates that, in reference to Algorithm 1, these magnitudes reflect the 'strength' with which the corresponding nodes belong to their respective communities

- The script **example_GBFPUM.m** provides an example of usage of the whole package by testing the GBF-PUM signal approximation scheme in combination with the chosen community detection method

Let's focus on the routines contained in the *./core* subfolder, which included several MATLAB functions, some for graph partitioning into two or more disjoint communities, and others for applying a GBF-PUM signal approximation scheme on graphs. The community detection algorithms are an implementation of the spectral methods introduced by M. Newman (for more details, see [1] and [2]) based on the maximization of the modularity. The routines for the kernel-based interpolation scheme based on a Partition of Unity Method, instead, are imported (and, in some cases, updated) from [5] and [6].

- The function **algorithm_1.m** is used to divide the graph into two disjoint communities, based on the leading eigenvector $u_1$ of the modularity matrix, while **algorithm_1_magnitudes.m** is used to visualize the magnitudes of $u_1$

- The function **algorithm_2.m** is used to divide the graph into two disjoint communities, based on the eigenvector $u_2$ corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian

- The function **algorithm_3.m** is used to divide the graph into more than two communities by iteratively applying one of the previous algorithms until no further subdivision increases the graph's modularity

- The function **calculate_modularity.m** is used to compute the modularity of a given graph partition

- The functions **GBF_gengraph.m** and **GBF_sim_rballs.m** are imported from [6] and used to generate the graph from different datasets

- The functions **GBF_domainaugment.m**, **GBF_genPUM.m** are imported (and, in the first case, updated) from [5] and used to generate a partition of unity on the graph, starting from the disjoint communities obtained through Algorithm 3

- The functions **GBF_genGBF.m**, **GBF_genGBF2.m**, **GBF_RLSGBF.m** provide a solution of the local interpolation problems and **GBF_RLSGBFPUM.m** calculates the global GBF-PUM signal approximation (all the routines are imported from [5], [6])

- The functions **GBF_spectrum.m** and **GBF_drawsignal.m** are imported from [6] and used to, respectively, calculate the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian and draw the signal on the nodes of the graph
